Has your colleague or classmate ever sent you a Google form that you can't view because you're signed in to the wrong Google account?

Not anymore!

1. Go to [google.com](https://google.com)
2. Switch to the account you want to use
3. Copy `?authuser=X` from the URL
4. Return to the form and remove `?edit_requested=true` from the URL
5. Add the `authuser` string to the URL and press enter

Voil√†!

Anyone with a Google Workspace account from their school or job as well as a personal Google account can relate to this struggle. Other shared items like docs and slides let you switch accounts easily. Not forms! Most people do the dance of opening an incognito window and signing in to the correct account or even signing out of all accounts just to view the form. Please, Google, add a "Switch Accounts" button to Google forms!
